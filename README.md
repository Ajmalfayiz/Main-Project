                                                     IoT Based Automated Medicine Dispenser:                                            


This project involves a medicine dispenser that supplies necessary emer-
gency medicine anywhere, anytime. Be it rural or urban location, the dispenser will
be able to provide first aid before further diagnosis. Anyone with a registered RFID
tag can access any of the medicine dispensers. The registered user must download
the mobile application in order get medicines. To know the amount of medicines in
a dispenser and to keep a check on his history he can use the app. If the person is a
new user, he has to scan the card and enter a 4-digit pin corresponding to the card.
This will act as the user verification. Later on he can approach any dispenser as he
has access now. The history of the user will be recorded in the database.
